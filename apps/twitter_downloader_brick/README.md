      "global": {
          "collection": "account",
          "prefix": "account",
          "custom": {
              "hub": [
                  "id"
                ]
            },
          fields:[
            {
              "id": "screen_name",
              "name": "screen_name",
              "type": "string-32",
              "object":"user"
            },
            {
              "id": "date",
              "name": "date",
              "type": "string-32",
              "command": "now"

      }
    }

## Twitter configuration

Configuration consists of 4 parts.

entities - part you specify entities you want to download.
         - fields are differentiated by object/command attribute
            -object attribute is using 'id' attribute of object 'user'
            -command is custom field
                - possible values
                    -now => returns current date YYYY/MM/DD
                    -now+n => returns future or past date depending on n
                    -'xyz' => returns 'xyz'
credentials - part you specify twitter credentials to twitter account used to scan other twitter accounts.
twitter_accounts - accounts you want to scan and tweet to download considering date options
